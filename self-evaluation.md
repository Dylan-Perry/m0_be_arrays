# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel semi-confident, and am both nervous and excited to continue utilizing arrays. For some reason, arrays have always been difficult for my brain to grasp - but I think that will alleviate as I continue to work with them.

# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I think I'm good for now. Just excited to continue into the next lessons!

# What questions do you have about Arrays?
None at the moment, though I'm sure that will change soon.
